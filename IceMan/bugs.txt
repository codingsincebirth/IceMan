bugs fixed
dig towards ice, entire program
    bounds not setup correctly
    remove ice if y < 60 was wrong
iceman went through boulder
    iceman didnt check for boulder in do something
boulder fell when only 1 ice was removed underneath
    fixed with distance function
boulder didnt fall all the way
    probably fixed with distance function
objects still overlapped
    fixed with distance function
rightmost column ice wouldnt be deleted
    not sure how it was solved
distance function entirely messed up overlapping and boulder fall check
    parameters were swapped
status line was not showing up
    setGameStatText was placed at end of move(), so it never got called because move() returned a game state before ever calling setGameStatText
    fixed by placing setGameStatText at beginning
sonar wouldnt pick up
    when the sonar time to live runs out, we forgot to call isDead() to remove it
    sonar would properly be removed when player picks it up, but not when naturally despawns
    putting isDead why ticks run out fixed it
gold decrementing by 2
    when dropping gold, it would go down by two
    turns out we did num_gold-- as well as calling dec_gold() which also num_gold--

bugs to fix
water pool spawns in ice
    set water pool depth to go in front of ice
    maybe its a object vs visual bug, or doesnt check for ice at all
